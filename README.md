# TextAdventure in C++

This is a simple text adventure in which a player ventures into a cave to defeat a dragon and moves about a 3 x 3 array with the dragon in the center.  
It is currently a work in progress, although the skeleton of the idea is present.  
The only thing that really needs to be added is the combat.

This was a quick side project I was working on between deliverables throughout college.

## How to Play

To begin, simply read through the text as it appears.  It will prompt you to name your character and select a weapon to fight the dragon with.
Most prompts when the adventure begins can be answered with a simple 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.

Once the character reaches the cave, you and the dragon will take turns attacking.  

On the dragon's turn, it will choose one of 3 attacks at random that will deal a set value of damage.

On your turn you may move in one direction and attack the dragon a number of times based on the speed of the weapon.

**Win the game by getting the dragon to zero health, at which point the game ends.**
